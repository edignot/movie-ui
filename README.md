## About:

This is a simple MERN full stack application that pulls movie data from downstream[`The Movie Database API`](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction) API, displays trending movies and allows users to search movies by name, up-vote and down-vote movies.

## Completed MVP User Stories:

- [ ] A user should be able to search movie by title and see list of all results matching the search keyword.
- [ ] If downstream API has more that 20 results matching the search input, implement pagination and fetch only one page at a time.
- [ ] A user should be able to click on any movie and see additional info about it
- [ ] A user should be able to up-vote or down-vote any movie and all movies that has any votes should be stored to the database
